# What is this?
This is a simple proj which just uses MinHook to hook the VAC module load stub within `steamservice.dll`.

# Use instructions
You can use this tool two ways. 
### Option A: Launch steam as admin
If you launch steam as admin, you have to inject your compiled DLL into steam.exe.
### Option B: Launch steam as No UAC
If you launch steam in non elevated mode, you have to inject your compiled DLL into steamservice.exe
